In 2015 I became a member of FRC team 4561: the TerrorBytes. I fell in love with the process of designing robots, building robots, and most importantly competing with robots. Since then I have built and competed with over a dozen robots of all sizes in FIRST robotics, combat robotics, school competitions, and more. This blog will be a mix of me archiving old projects and posting about new projects. If you have any questions, feel free to shoot me an email.
