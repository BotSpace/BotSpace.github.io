One of the most important ability an autonamous robot could have is the ability to see and understand its suroundings. There are may ways to acomplish this. If you have alot of time or money to blow you could use a LIDAR ToF sensor or vision processing, but these systems are often unnessiscary. In the past I have used the ever popular HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensor modules, but these devices come with several flaws, mainly they are bulky, imprecise, and dont work on surfaces that absorb sound.

I learned of a better sensor when researching MicroMouse. Most MicroMice use custom IR distance sensors.
