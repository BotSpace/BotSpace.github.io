title: Differential Swerve Drive
---
Differential Swerve Drive is a project I started over a year ago. In FRC, Swerve Drive is a high risk high reward drivetrain type that combines the omnidirectional capabilitys of mechanum drive with the stealler traction of normal tank drive. The down side is the mechanical and programming complexity that is required to pull it off. For most teams it is simply not effort effective to use, but in recent years it has been becoming more popular. For example teams like Stryke Force, Jack in the Bot, and MadTown have all brought swerve to einstine finals.

Yes swerve drive is very cool, but I am not a fan of the bulky, heavy, and complicated modules. I would normally have never touched swerve drive but a [post on Chief Delphi](https://www.chiefdelphi.com/t/pic-differential-swerve-module-971/160525) caught my eye about a year and a half ago. ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/87184d96156d92dc88a3e1ce8f5b0717c6e520d9_2_1035x750.jpeg)

At the time and to this day I am infatuated with how clean and elegant this 971 module is. I was inspired to ~~copie~~ create my own version of the design and use it in MiniFRC 5. A friend and I worked on it a lot during our winter break in late 2017, even to the point where we got a module working (Sorry for the poor video quality).
