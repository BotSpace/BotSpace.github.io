title: Differential Swerve Drive
---
Differential Swerve Drive is a project I started over a year ago. In FRC, Swerve Drive is a high risk high reward drivetrain type that combines the omnidirectional capabilitys of mechanum drive with the stealler traction of normal tank drive. The down side is the mechanical and programming complexity that is required to pull it off. For most teams it is simply not effort effective to use, but in recent years it has been becoming more popular. For example teams like Stryke Force, Jack in the Bot, and MadTown have all brought swere to einstine finals.
