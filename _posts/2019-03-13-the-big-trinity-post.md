title: PyroBot at the Trinity College International Fire Fighting Robot Contest
---
## The Goal
the _Trinity College International Fire Fighting Robot Contest_ is A yearly event at which robots are tasked with navigating a simple maze and extingishing a candle somewhere within as quickly as possible. on April 12th I flew up to Hartford Conneticuit to Compete with my robot: Pyrobot. ![pyrobot final.PNG]({{site.baseurl}}/images/pyrobot final.PNG)
The pyrobot in this picture is very diffrent from the one I flew out with. I had high hopes for PyroBot but as usual, everything is twice as hard as you think it will be. Despite the setbacks I am happy with the project as I was able to pull off a small victory in the end.

## The Rules
I won't go into too much detail but the gist is, you are allowed to do five total runs and there are three levels. You may only attempt a harder level once you have completed the one before it. You get 600 points for each level you dont complete (lower scores are better). Your total final score is the sum of your best scores on each level. Level 1 is the most simple. You know where all the walls will be and the only obstical is a stuffed animal randomly placed at one of 3 locations. Level 2 adds carpets, multiple wall conifgurations, and "decorations" on some of the walls (ie. Mirrors and fabric). In level 3 they combine two mazes and start you randomly in the first. The goal is two blow out three candles in the second maze as well "rescue a baby" (move a doll from the second maze to the first).

## The Plan
A friend and I began work on our stratagy over 2 months ago. At first the plan was to do almost everything and do it in the style of a micromouse robot. We noticed that most of the robots at past competitions were relativle slow (except for this bot from china, by far) but even the Chinese robot doesnt compare to the speed of a micromouse. I splurged on some of the expensive IR LEDs ([sfh4545](https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/osram-opto-semiconductors-inc/SFH-4545/475-2919-ND/2205955?utm_adgroup=Optoelectronics&slid=&gclid=CjwKCAjwzPXlBRAjEiwAj_XTEY_Bn_ii0FJhxkulefOmwNh326yjtMyb8GEm5WsBmxhUt5ty_riYpBoCXm8QAvD_BwE)) and phototransistors ([teft4300](https://www.mouser.com/datasheet/2/427/teft4300-84750.pdf)) used by many micromice for distance sensing. The "go to" motors for micromice were a bit out of my price budget so I went with some agreesivly geared N20 motors that had intagrated encoders. The Motors were driven by a chip I am very familar with, an L293D Dual H-Bridge. There is really no limit on what fan you are allowed to use to blow out the candle so I chose to use the BLDC motor off of a RC plane I once built. Next I chose the battery. After some testing with a 7.4V (2 cell) battery I wasent happy with the speed of the robot so I decided to use a 11.1V (3 cell) battery instead, which also improved our fan preformance. To control the robot I considered useing an esp32, but ultimatly went with an arduino nano because if its size and I was familar with it. Again inspired by MicroMice, I chose to make the chassis of the robot a custom circuit Board, Fabricated on an OtherMill at my universitys maker space. Finally we figured finding the candle was a great vision processing task and planned to use my friends Jvois Vision processing camera with an IR pass filter. After carefully designing the 3dprinted parts, a circuit board and soldering some tedious wires, we thought we had the hardest problems solved.

## The Problems
### The nanos
I figured from the start it would take two iterations to design the circuit board: an initial prototype and a final with all the kinks worked out. However when I was designing the robot I made a fatal error. In order to save space I hung the nano underneath the robot where there was not enough vertical space for female headers, meaning that I soldered the nano directly to the circuit board. This had the awful side effect that if we ever fried a nano, we had to replace the entire chassis. You may think Im stupid for even attemping a stratagy like that, but to be fair it has worked great for me before on one of my combat robots. The diffrence between that project and this one is the combat robot was less complex and ran on much less than 12v. After 3 bricked chassis I gave up on the hanging method and moved the nano to the top of the board with female headers. this ended up being the right choice by far as I fried 2 more nanos during developement that I was able to "hot swap" out. Unfourtunatly by the time I made this switch we had lost 5 days (its hard to mill these boards) and I only had time to make a use the first itteration of the "hotswap" design. 

### Voltage regulation
the third nano I fried by supplying 12V to vin. The documentation says that nanos can run off of 12V but I looked into it and it seems that the 5V linear voltage regulators on chinese clones can handle only around 7V to 10V. It was at this point I said "screw it" and added not one but three switch mode regulators to the robot: a 7.5V reg to keep the nano happy, a 5V reg for the Jevois as it could draw up to an Amp, and a 3V reg for the IR LEDs. I was going to power the LEDs off the the arduinos 3.3V line but they too draw a decent amount of current and I wanted to reduce the strain on the nano as much as possible.

### The Boards
On top of the strategic errors surrounding the custom boards, the boards themselves were of poor quality and cause many issues. It was a pain to design them because any jump from one side of the board to the other has to be done with vias, for example all of the arduino headers could only be soldered/accessed on the bottom of the board. The most common physical issue is a trace would break (or in some cases fry) and I would have to run a wire to jump the connection. The worst issue was at one point I ripped about 6 pads off of one section of the board and had to do some very janky wiring to fix it.

### The Jevois
If the other issues were thumb tacks, this issue felt like a train spike in the coffin. We only got the robot fully together a couple of days before the competition. At this point we knew we couldnt "do everything", but we at least felt like we could still be competitive.![pyrobyte_all_together.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/images/pyrobyte_all_together.jpg)
It was then that had had to drop the Jevios. While my friend could get it to find the candle excelently when plugged into the robot, we could not for the life of us get it to spit any of its data out over serial. We worked on this issue till 4:00AM the night before my flight and to this day we dont know what the problem was. I flew into Hartford with a robot that could barely naviage a maze and not only had never seen a candle before but at that point was totally blind.

## The Bodge
When I started this project I pictured rolling up to Hartford with a beatiful well crafted robot that was basically a Micromouse with a fan on it. I'm very much a prefectionist; the robot would be a clean, meticulously designed, and well crafted machine. On Friday night a switch flipped in my head and my mentality changed. I couldnt let perfect be the enemy of good and I just wanted to have the robot work at all. There were minor electrical issues to fix but the main issue was finding and pointing twords the candle. _At the hotel_ I canbalized some of the ir distance sensors off of the frount of the robot and repurposed their photo transistors to instead look for the candle. I arrived at the competition site at 7:15 and was the first person inside the venue. After I set up my pit I spent the next 4 hours fixing minor electrical issues and preparing my robot to be inspected before noon. Once
