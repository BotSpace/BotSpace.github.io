title: PyroBot at the Trinity College International Fire Fighting Robot Contest
---
## The Goal
the _Trinity College International Fire Fighting Robot Contest_ is A yearly event at which robots are tasked with navigating a simple maze and extingishing a candle somewhere within. on April 12th I flew up to Hartford Conneticuit to Compete with my robot: Pyrobot.![pyrobot final.PNG]({{site.baseurl}}/images/pyrobot final.PNG)
The pyrobot in this picture is very diffrent from the one I flew out with. I had high hopes for PyroBot but at every step of developement I was hit with hard reality. Despite the setbacks I am happy with the project as I was able to pull off a small victory in the end.

## The Plan
