title: Fixing my Broken Mouse
---
### WIP
when it comes to buying mice, I have a lot of requirements. It has be wireless, left-handed (or ambidexterous), cheap, and a "gaming" mouse. I found my preferred model years ago, an [E-Blue Cobra](https://www.amazon.com/Ergonomic-Gaming-Bigger-Scroll-EMS151BK/dp/B00DS6AJ86), and since then I have been through three of them. What always goes first is the scroll wheel, and after my third mouse broke I decided it was time fix it instead of buying a new one. I started by taking apart my Cobra: ![cobra E-blue1.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/images/cobra E-blue1.jpg)
