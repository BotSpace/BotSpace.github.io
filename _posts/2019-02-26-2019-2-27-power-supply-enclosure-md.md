title: Acquiring a Cheap Power Supply
---
For years I have tested my electronics projects with 'improvised power supplys', usually 5V from my laptop USB port, some AA batteries, or a lipo battery. I decided I had enough of that. 

Call me cheap, but I ended up buying a [power supply module](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/RD-DPS5005-Communication-Function-Constant-Voltage-current-Step-down-Power-Supply-module-buck-Voltage-converter-LCD/1000004290003.html?spm=a2g0s.12269583.0.0.22736152uV6uFs) off of Aliexpress. Could I have gotten a lab bench power supply off of ebay for slightly more? Maybe. Would it have been as much fun as getting to design my own enclosure? No.

The model I bought was the RD DPS5005. Rated for 50V 5A, it is almost overkill for type of projects I do, but thats not a problem. By the time the module arrived I had already collected all the other parts I would need for the build. The [banana plugs](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/RD-DPS5005-Communication-Function-Constant-Voltage-current-Step-down-Power-Supply-module-buck-Voltage-converter-LCD/1000004290003.html?spm=a2g0s.12269583.0.0.22736152uV6uFs) were the only thing I had to buy seperatly, I had the AC-DC converter and power switch lying around. The AC-DC converter can only output a max of 16V at 500mAh but that should be enough for now. If I ever need more power I can buy a better converter.

The enclosure is custom designed and 3D printed. It went through a couple iterations and am still not quite happy with it but it gets the job done. I was down to my last roll of PLA and ran out during my first attempt to print the enclosure. After I ordered more PLA, I tried twice to print it with only other filament I had laying around, some orange PETG, but both prints failed.

Before my 4th attempt I changed the model from a single bodie design to a split chassis and faceplate. I would usually attach these kind of parts with bolts but wanted to test using zipties.

the zipties wern't too much of a pain but If I make a V2 I will definatly use bolts.
