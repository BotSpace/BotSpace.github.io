title: Power Supply Enclosure
---
For years I have tested my electronics projects with 'improvised power supplys', usually 5V from my laptop USB port, some AA batteries, or a lipo battery. Well that ends today. As a budding Electrical Engineer I need a real power supply. Well, almost real.

Call me cheap, but these blank Chinese power supplies caught my eye on Aliexpress and I rolled with it. Could I have gotten a lab bench power supply off of ebay for around the same price? Maybe. Would it have been as much fun as getting to design my own enclosure? No.

The design is pretty straight forward. I used x comps. I thought about fan.
